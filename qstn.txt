1.  what is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous operations?

    Synchronous = Wait for each task to finish.
    Asynchronous = Don’t wait — move on and handle the result later (using callbacks, promises, or async/await).

2.  what is DOM?

    The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents.
    It represents the structure of an HTML or XML page as a tree of objects, where each element (like <p>, <div>, <img>, etc.) is a node in that tree.

3.  What are the data types in JS?

    1-Primitive Data types
        String,Number,Boolean,Undefined,Null,Symbol
    
    Key Points:
    Primitive values are immutable (can’t be changed directly).
    Stored by value, not by reference.
    Used for simple data like numbers, text, and true/false conditions.
    
    2-Non-Primitive DataTypes
        Object,Array,function

    Key Characteristics:
    Mutable: You can modify their contents.
    Stored by reference: When assigned to another variable, both point to the same memory location.
    Can contain multiple values: Unlike primitive types, which hold only one.

4.  What is an Event in JS?

    Event is an action or occurance that happens to the browser
    Event handling means writing a js code that will run when a specific event occurs

    multiple ways to handle the event:

    1- Inline Event handling
    2- Using DOM properties
    3- Using Add event listner

5.  What ared closure in JS?

    A closure is a function that remembers and can access variables from its outer (parent) function’s scope, even after the parent function has finished executing.

6.  What is the difference between MAP and ForEach?

    forEach() - Executes a function for each element (no return).
    map() - Executes a function and returns a new array with modified values.

7.  What is a CallBack function in JS?

    function passing another function as an argument
    KeyFeatures:
    > it handle asynchronous(things can happen independently, without waiting for each other.) operations
    > customise behaviour of general purpose function
    > avoid blocking code execution

8.  What is Inheritence in JS?

    Inheritance in JavaScript is a feature that allows one class or object to access the properties and methods of another.
    It helps in code reusability, organization, and creating hierarchies between objects (like parent–child relationships).

9.  What is the purpose of Try Catch Statement in JS?

    The try...catch statement is used to handle errors in JavaScript programs — so that even if something goes wrong, your code doesn’t crash and can continue running smoothly.

10. What is the purpose of AddEventListener Method in JS?

    The addEventListener method is used to attach an event handler to a specific HTML element.

    It allows your webpage to respond to user actions (like clicks, mouse movements, typing, or form submissions) without overwriting existing event handlers.

11. What is the diffrence between querySelector and querySelector all?
    
    querySelector → Selects the first matching element.
    querySelectorAll → Selects all matching elements as a NodeList.

12. What is the diffrence between Null and undefined?

    undefined → “Value not assigned.”
    null → “Value intentionally empty.”

13. what is the difference between == and === in JS?

    == → Checks value only, allows type conversion.
    === → Checks value + type, stricter and safer.

14. What is Hoisting in JS?

    Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope (global or function) before the code is executed.

15. What is the 'THIS' keyword in JS?

    The this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code.
    Its value depends on how a function is called, not where it is defined.

16. What are the diffrent ways to define function in JS?

    Declaration → standard, hoisted.

    Expression → assigned to variable.

    Arrow → short + lexical this.

    Anonymous → no name, often callback.

    IIFE → runs immediately.

    CallBack -> function passing another function as an argument

17. What is the purpose of LET,VAR,CONST in JS? 

    var → old, function-scoped, can redeclare.

    let → modern, block-scoped, can reassign but not redeclare.

    const → block-scoped, cannot reassign, must initialize.
    
18. what is the difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive data types?
    
    Primitive → single, simple, immutable values, copied by value.

    Non-Primitive → complex, mutable structures, copied by reference.

19. What is the Use of Spread Operator?

    The spread operator (...) allows you to expand an array, object, or iterable into individual elements.
    It is widely used for copying, merging, or passing multiple values.

20. What is Ternary Operator in JS?

    Ternary operator is a compact if-else used to assign or return values based on a condition:
    condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

21. What is Rest Parameter?

    The rest parameter allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

    It is denoted by ... before the parameter name.
